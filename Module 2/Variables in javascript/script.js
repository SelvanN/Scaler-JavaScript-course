* What are Variables?

* How to Declare variable?

* Variables in action?

# Variables in javascript 

* Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

* Variables means anything that can vary. In javascript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on 

eg: var a = 5
 
 
 # The var Keyword

 * There is a reserved keyword in javascript which is used to declare variables that is the 'var' keyword.
 
 * var = 20 --- number or integer

 * var greet = ' Hello ' ---- string , u can use both a single quotes('') and double quotes("")

 * var PersonName = "Jhon Doe"

 * var is Available = true --- boolean , true or false


# Dynamically and Statically typed languages?

* java is a Statically typed language

* javascript is a Dynamically typed language

* So, java and javascript both are different languages, not that both are same 


1. Statically : each variable and expression is already known at compile time.

# java code :

import java.io.*;
class scaler{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int var = 20;
        char letter = 'm';
        string s1 = "java";
        Boolean isAvailable = true
    }
}


2. Dynamically : variable can receive different values at runtime and their type is defined at run-time.

# javascript code :

var a = 20 
var greet = 'Hello'
var PersonName = "Jhon doe"
var isAvailable = true


# Rules to declare a Variable

* All javascript variables must be identified with unique names.
* These unique names are called identifiers.
* Identifiers can be short names ( like x and y ) or more descriptive names ( age, sum, totalVolume).

# Rules:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscore( _ ), and dollar sings( $ ).

2. Names must start with a letters

3. Names can also start with a $ and _ ( but we will not use it in this tutorial)

4. Names are case sensitive ( Y and y are different variables)

5. Reserved words ( like javascript keywords) cannot be used as variable names.

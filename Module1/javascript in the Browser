1. JavaScript on the Browser?

* Almost Every Browser today is Empowered by JavaScript.

* Every Browser has an embedded JavaScript engine,
     - for eg: Chorme uses V8 Engine, Mozilla firefox uses spider monkey

* JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive".

* The programs in the language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
